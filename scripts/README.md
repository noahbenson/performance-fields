# Scripts

This directory contains the script used to generate Figure 3 of the manuscript
that this repository accompanies (Benson, Kupers, Barbot, Carrasco, &amp; Winawer, 2020).

Note that this script is maintained by Eline Kupers in the github repository
[github.com/elinekupers/pf_RV1](https://github.com/elinekupers/pf_RV1).
This repository is also required for this script to work, as well as the
[ISETBIO toolbox](https://github.com/isetbio/isetbio).

Additionally, the file `DROI_table.csv`, which is available at the
[OSF site](https://osf.io/5gprz/) for this project, must be plased in or 
symlinked into the directory `fullfile(pfRV1rootPath, 'external', 'data')`
in order for the script to work. See the script itself for additional
documentation.
